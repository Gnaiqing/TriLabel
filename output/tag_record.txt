00: use active weasul as label model, mlp as end model
01: comapre active learning with relief using smaller label budget per iteration
02: use metal as label model, mlp as end model
03: after pipeline update. Now use self-designed reviser and sampler, and the cost varies per data point
04: pipeline update. Now correct labels instead of revise LFs.
05: pipeline update. Now use Bayes' Theorem as theoretical background and support multiple ways to combine AL with DP.
